            Let's start by saying that tennis is a sport that we can practice in the sun, so it is very important that
            to maintain good skin we need to use sunscreen and hydrate very well. It is very important to apply lotion
            or moisturizing cream over the entire body: this care facilitates the recovery of epithelial tissue and
            restores softness. Drink plenty of water: more than ever, after spending a lot of time under the sun, it is
            essential to drink at least two liters of water a day to replace what is lost through sweat.
